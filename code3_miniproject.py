'''The "Introduction to Data Science" is a Year 1 course offered at NTU. This course attracts a
diverse group of students from various disciplines due to its widespread applicability and
popularity.
Recently, the course has experienced a significant increase in enrollment, with 6,000
students registered. These students are organized into 120 tutorial groups, each consisting
of 50 students. The course coordinator is facing challenges in efficiently forming teams for
a mini-project component of the course.
To address this issue, the course coordinator seeks your expertise in developing an
application capable of organizing students into teams of five for the data science miniproject. You are provided with a csv file (records.csv) consist of 6,000 student records with
their Tutorial Group, Student ID, Name, School, Gender, and CGPA. The application must
ensure fairness and diversity when forming teams by considering the following factors:
1. School Affiliation: To ensure a mix of knowledge and skills, no team should have a
majority of students from the same school.
2. Gender: To promote gender diversity, no team should have a majority of students
from the same gender.
3. Current CGPA: To balance academic performance, teams should not consist
predominantly of students with very high or very low CGPAs.
The objective of your program is to strive for balanced and diverse team compositions,
taking into account the aforementioned criteria. Some tolerant are acceptable if happen
that the tutorial group are dominated by student from the same background or profile.'''
